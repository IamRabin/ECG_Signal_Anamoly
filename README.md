# ECG_Signal_Anamoly
This repo contains the work for the class project which was related to detection of anamoly in ECG signal using LSTM Auto-encoder.

# Data: 
The [data](http://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000) is about ECG signal which contains 5,000 instances. It has five types of heartbeats classes. 

- Normal(N)

- Premature ventricular Contraction(R-on-T PVC)

- Supra -ventricular Premature or Ectopica Beat(SP or EB)

- Unclassified Beat(UB)
